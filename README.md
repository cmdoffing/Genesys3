# Genesys

Genesys (GENErating SYStem) is an F# web app that generates F# / Giraffe / Giraffe.ViewEngine CRUD web apps. The Genesys approach to web app design is guided by Parts 1 and 2 of Scott Wlaschin's book "Domain Modeling Made Functional". Genesys departs greatly from the implementation described in Part 3.
